    <p class="bd-lead">
      Node package manager or npm is a free package manager and installer for Node.js. With npm, you can donwnload and manage dependencies of your
      project. Also, it is world's largest software library, which contains over 800 000 packages. There is a special website called
      <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npmjs.com</a> where you can search for the packages that you need for your project. But since everyone can
      publish their own packages, make sure to check that the package is safe to use. The easiest way to check it is to look at the weekly downloads
      count - the more downloads the better.

    <h2 class="bd-title">How to initialize npm package?</h2>

    <p class="bd-lead">
      If you have a project, and you want to quickly set up your npm package, you can use <code>npm init</code> in your command prompt. But before
      that make sure that you are in the project folder. Use <code>cd </code> command to easily navigate in the command prompt. When initializing
      through npm init, you can provide various information about the project, like: package name, version, description, entry point, test command,
      git repository, keywords, author and license. Then, npm will create package.json and other files needed for dependency managment.

    <h2 class="bd-title">What is package.json?</h2>
    <div class="bd-lead">
      A package.json file:
      <ul>
        <li>lists the packages your project depends on</li>
        <li>specifies versions of a package that your project can use using semantic versioning rules</li>
        <li>makes your build reproducible, and therefore easier to share with other developers</li>
      </ul>

    <h2 class="bd-title">Dependencies that we used and how to install them</h2>
    <div class="bd-lead">
      In our classes we have used <b>nodemon</b> and <b>express</b>, but since I had some problems with nodemon that I could not fix, I have used
      <b>supervisor</b> instead. <br />
      <br />
      What are these packages for?
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>nodemon</b> helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory
          are detected.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>express</b> is a back end web application framework for Node.js, which is designed for building web applications and APIs. You can find
          more about express <a href="/express">here</a>
        </li>
        <li><b>supervisor</b> is a nodemon alternative, it restarts programs when a file changes.</li>
      </ul>
      To install the package, type <code>npm i package-name</code>, and don't forget to be in your project's directory. To uninstall the package, type
      <code>npm un package-name</code>. Also, you can use flag <code>-g</code> to install package globally. <br />
      <br />
      How to use these packages?
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>nodemon</b> type <code>nodemon app-name.js</code> in the CLI. Nodemon will start the program and restart it when changes are detected.
          You can also specify which files to "listen" for.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>express</b> to start working with express, you need to create app.js file, import express, start the server and specify the port. The
          code for those actions is below. You can find more about working with express in the "REST" and "SSR" pages.
        </li>
        <div>
          <pre class="syntax">
                const express = require("express");
                const app = express();
                app.listen(3000, () => {
                    console.log("server is running on", 3000);
                });
            </pre
          >
        </div>
        <li><b>supervisor</b> same as the nodemon, but use <code>supervisor</code> keyword instead of <code>nodemon</code></li>
      </ul>
